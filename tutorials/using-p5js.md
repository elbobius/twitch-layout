[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a library to make javascript more accessible to people.

It can easily be implemented into NodeCG simply by including both the standard p5.js file and the [p5.dom](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.dom) library in the `shared` folder as this folder is always mounted.

p5.js can be used as normal and NodeCG calls are included when needed.

An example bundle containing a counter and a lower third is located in the [NodeCG simple examples](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg-simple-examples) repo.
